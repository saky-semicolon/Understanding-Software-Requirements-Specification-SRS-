## What is SRS?
- SRS is a guide for developers, instructing them on what to build for a system.
- It details how the system should behave and what users expect from it, encompassing both user requirements and system requirements.

## Purpose of SRS
- The SRS document precisely defines what the software will do.
- It aids in understanding all the necessary aspects required to develop the software and plan its functionality.
- It allows customers to provide feedback and opinions on the software.

## Role of SRS
1. Software Requirements Specification (SRS) must accurately describe all the functionalities the software must perform.
2. Requirements may arise from the tasks the software needs to accomplish or from unique project aspects.

## SRS Format
 Detailed description of writing an SRS; template provided in the repository:-

## Characteristics of SRS
- Correct: Every requirement stated in the SRS is a requirement of the software.
- Complete: Includes all functional, performance, design, and external interface requirements.
- Unambiguous: Every requirement has precisely one interpretation.
- Consistent: Maintains internal consistency.
- Ranked Importance: Distinguishes between essential and desirable requirements.

## Readers of SRS
- Business Stakeholders
- Project Managers
- Developers
- Designers
- Testers
- Regulatory Compliance Officers
- Documentation Teams

## Benefits of SRS
- Establishes the basis for agreement between customers and suppliers on the software product's functionality.
- Reduces development effort.
- Provides a basis for estimating costs and schedules.
- Serves as a baseline for validation and verification.
- Serves as a basis for enhancement.

## SRS Acceptance
- Status: "Accepted"
- SRS acceptance marks a pivotal agreement point, ensuring alignment among stakeholders and setting the foundation for successful software development.
