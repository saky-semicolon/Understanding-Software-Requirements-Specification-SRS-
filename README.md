## What is SRS?
- SRS is a guide for developers, instructing them on what to build for a system.
- It details how the system should behave and what users expect from it, encompassing both user requirements and system requirements.

## Purpose of SRS
- The SRS document precisely defines what the software will do.
- It aids in understanding all the necessary aspects required to develop the software and plan its functionality.
- It allows customers to provide feedback and opinions on the software.

## Role of SRS
1. Software Requirements Specification (SRS) must accurately describe all the functionalities the software must perform.
2. Requirements may arise from the tasks the software needs to accomplish or from unique project aspects.

## SRS Format
- Detailed description of writing an SRS; template provided.
